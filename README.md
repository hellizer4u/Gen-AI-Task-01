# 🧠 Text Generation using GPT-2

Train a model to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given prompt using GPT-2, a transformer model developed by OpenAI. This project focuses on fine-tuning GPT-2 on a custom dataset to generate text that mimics the style, tone, and structure of your training data.
